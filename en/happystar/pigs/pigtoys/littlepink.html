<p class="a"> Little Pink Brother is the brother of Little Pink Sister. The two pigs were bought at the same time. Little Pink Brother was isolated from the other pigs during one time.</p>
<p class="a">Little Pink Brother is the newest-looking of all the Little Pink Pigs. He likes to stay at home, and he sometimes likes to go inside his house made of wood blocks. Little Pink Brother's favorite foods are vegetables, unlike most little pink pigs, who like to eat pigs. Little Pink Brother mostly likes to read in quiet places, but he sometimes also plays with the other pigs.</p>
<p class="a">Sometime around 2013 or 2014, Little Pink Brother started hiding in a cabinet! The other little pink pigs couldn't find him, so they assumed that he went to Piglen for fun. Little Pink Brother stayed there for a few years before finally being found by Giant Pig in 2019. The outside world had changed a lot since he first started hiding!</p>
