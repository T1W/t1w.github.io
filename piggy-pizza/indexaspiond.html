<h1 class="center">April Pizza Day</h1>
<p class="a">To celebrate April Pizza Day, Mushroom Pig, Strawberry Pig, and Pineapple Pig are eating pizza together! The pizza is a pepperoni mushroom pizza. Oink oink!</p>
<p class="a">Click and drag the pizza slices. Drag a pizza slice onto a piggy to let the piggy eat it. If a pizza slice is dragged off-screen, the piggies won't be able to eat it. If one piggy eats more pizza than both other piggies, that piggy will be very happy. Piggies who don't eat pizza will be sad. Click the piggies to make them jump!</p>

<h1 class="center">Happy Star</h1>
<p class="a">The name "Happy Star" comes from nowhere in particular, and it can be stylized as "Happy ❊". The name originally used the character "✳". However, the character is sometimes shown as an emoji, so now the character "❊" is used instead. Happy Star only has one section right now, which is about toy pigs, but it may have more in the future. (I'd like it to have an art section and a story section.)</p>
